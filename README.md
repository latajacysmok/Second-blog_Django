# Second-blog_Django
A simple blog in Django. Maintaining the CRUD convention. We display posts on the main page, the ability to create new ones, edit existing ones and delete them. This is the blog's paging.

2018-02-07 update:
I added a search engine for posts, date of publication, sharing in facebook, twwiter and google +, the opportunity to like and comment.
